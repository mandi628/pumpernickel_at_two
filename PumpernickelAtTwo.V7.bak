		<SceneContent><![CDATA[Jess hummed to herself as she bustled around the kitchen. Her friend, restaurant-owner Sarah Jackson, let her rent the space in the mornings for her catering business. Today, Jess had prepared some traditional pasta dishes for a Chamber of Commerce meeting across the street. The downtown location of Sarah’s restaurant was a definite plus.
She wiped her sleeve across her forehead to move her mousy brown bangs out of the way. Her limp hair always got in the way, and she had forgotten her bandanna today. Jess groaned as she realized she had probably smeared marinara sauce from the sleeve of her purple chef’s jacket onto her forehead.
She tossed the shrimp into the hot frying pan a little more forcefully than she meant to, and one skittered away. Taking deep breaths, she tried to calm herself by resuming her song, but her outer calm was definitely not a reflection of the turmoil she felt inside. The recent documents from her divorce attorney left her feeling raw and isolated.
Michael had been her best friend, her confidant, her cheerleader. They had shared dreams and goals. She had worked around the clock, edging her way up the ladder at various restaurants in the city. She left her job as a sous chef at one restaurant to be a head chef at another. The owner of the new place had been a long-time fan and friend from college, and had made her a really good offer.
The shrimp sizzled in the pan and she sprinkled the minced garlic over it before adding the Alfredo sauce she had finished an hour before. Turning off the gas heat so as not to burn the sauce, Jess’ mind drifted back to her marriage and its failure.
The long hours of her work had given her limited time with Michael, who had climbed his own ladders in an engineering firm. They drifted apart over the months and years, became different people, and seemed to not fit together anymore.
“Why won’t you give me a family, Jess?” Michael had asked her one afternoon as they sat reading and sipping coffee. It was a rare day when they were home at the same time. She had done her best to schedule every Sunday off, but the needs of the kitchen often trumped the needs of her home. This day, she had started  with a much needed bubble bath and sat in her robe, lounging on the white sofa with her book in her lap. He had gone for a run while she was bathing, showered when he returned, and sat in the matching armchair with his magazine propped up on the side. They had talked about having kids years ago, when life seemed full of possibilities and time seemed endless.
“I didn’t know it was in the plan,” she responded meekly, realizing afterward that it wasn’t really the truth. She hadn’t put it off intentionally, but motherhood would have definitely slowed down her career plans.
Jess mindlessly tossed the saucy shrimps with the already-cooked pasta before dumping it into a baking pan and sprinkled it liberally with an earthy blend of cheeses. She put the pan in the oven to melt the cheese while the memory continued in her head.
“Kids were in the plan, but you abandoned it.”
“I never abandoned it. The plan just sort of took over.”
Michael’s brows furrowed at this. “We were supposed to have a life together,” he fumed. “What we have is ‘lives’. You do yours. I do mine. There is no us anymore.”
“What are you saying?”
“I’m saying I’m lonely. I’m saying this isn’t what I signed on for. I’m saying…” he swallowed audibly, hesitating just briefly, “I want out.”
The words rang in her ears. Her throat tightened as she crafted a response. But what was there to say? How do you respond to a declaration like that?
“Out? Like, a divorce?” The words rasped in her throat. “Without a chance to fix it? Change things?”
Michael was on his knees in front of the couch before she realized he had even moved.
“Oh, Jess. I don’t want to change you. You have gone after everything you’ve ever wanted, and I couldn’t be prouder. But I’m not a part of it. There’s no room in your life for me, and I want more. This just isn’t what I pictured.”
The food trays finished, Jess began gathering them and getting them ready to load. Her sous chef, Kyle, was due in moments to help load and serve the food at the meeting. Still locked in memory, the visions and images of her decaying marriage drifted into view.
Not only had Michael admitted to being in an affair at the time, he confessed to multiple affairs before that day. His loneliness seemed to be apparent to everyone but Jess. Their friends were not surprised as they made their divorce public. Many had expressed surprise that it had lasted as long as it did. And as the divorce moved forward, his attorney attacked with vengeance, attempting to claim rights to her retirement earnings, her jewelry, even a portion of her future inheritance from her parents, who were still living. The joke of it all, to Jess, was that Michael had been slaving after his own career, been given partnership in an engineering firm, and won several national awards during their marriage. Not only was his salary twice hers, but he was the one with a personal property value. He had purchased a lake property, and a boat and several jet-skis to go with it. She hadn’t had time for boating or vacations.
Jess’ attention snapped back to the task at hand as Allison fumbled through the door. The door girl was an amazing administrative assistant, and the catering business would have died a quick and horrible death without her, but Allison’s lack of physical ability to stay on her feet for a full day terrified Jess. She had banished her from the kitchen on multiple occasions.
“How’s it going, Allison?”
“Oh, it’s alright today, Jess.” Allison also had a touch of a dramatic nature, and always sounded melancholy. She reminded Jess of Eeyore, from the Winnie-the-Pooh books. “Invoices are paid, and I’ll be making the deposits this afternoon, when you finish the job today.” She clutched the door jamb for support, hovering in the doorway so she wouldn’t be near the knives.
“Great! We on for dinner with my parents tonight?” Wednesday was Family Dinner Night at the Burovsky’s. Allison had been adopted into the family when she first moved to the area.
“Of course! I love your mom’s casseroles,” her eyes lighting with hunger. “Oh, and we have a new job. Felicity, at the Arts Museum, is planning a Chinese exhibit to open on Chinese New Year, and she wants you to cater the meal.”
“Excellent! I love Felicity’s events. They are always so original. I’ll text her this afternoon and set up a meeting.”
Allison leaned forward, as if planning to take a step. “Do you need help with that?”
“No!” Jess barked, much more forcefully than she had planned. Chuckling lightly she continued, “I mean, no, thanks. I’ve got this. Ready to load up and head over. Kyle is due any minute…”
A rush of cold air from the January temperatures interrupted her as the door opened, and a young, slender teen walked in.
“Hey, Jess. Cavalry's here. You ready?”
“Right on time. Let’s go.”]]></SceneContent>

		<SceneContent><![CDATA[As far as Chamber of Commerce meetings go, today's was no different. She half-listened to the speaker as she set out the trays of food.
Kyle set out the disposable dishes and organized the drinks from the venue's kitchen. They didn't talk much - didn't have to, since this was not their first time around. Kyle had only been working with her for six months, but he was bright and ambitious. Her parents had recommended him for the job when they heard he was in the culinary program at the local tech school. They had watched him grow up in their neighborhood and seen him mature as he exercised his entrepreneurial muscles cutting grass for the neighborhood seniors. He always showed up on time, and never changed his prices, which were low for the fixed-income retirees.
Jess fell into a zone as she moved. The guests began to file into the serving line and the volume in the room became deafening with the din of general conversation. She scooped, served, and smiled in her usual routine. Some commented on the food as they passed, thanking her ahead of time. She nodded in acknowledgement. Others passed in complete oblivion - neither addressing the food or acknowledging her existence. She didn't mind. There were always people who thought they were too good for the "help."
After the line passed, Jess set about tidying up and clearing empty trays. She turned and almost ran smack into Felicity with a pan full of green beans.
"Jess! So sorry I sneaked up on you like that. I thought you saw me move, but you've been all starry-eyed since you got here."
"I have not, Felicity." Jess rolled her eyes at her friend. "At least I wouldn't call it starry-eyed. Just day-dreaming, I suppose." Jess had still not been able to shake her thoughts about her divorce.
"Well, you can fill me in at lunch tomorrow, huh? Where would you like to eat?"
"I had planned to text you this afternoon. How about Davidson's?"
Felicity's face brightened. "Ooo, those servers are hunky, aren't they? One o'clock work for you?"
Jess agreed and Felicity moved off. They had been friends since elementary school. Always on the prowl for new acquaintances, Felicity didn't stay too long in one place at gatherings. It wasn't that she hunted for romantic relationships. She just thrived on all relationships. Her day wasn't complete unless she met at least one new person every day. Her passion for networking made her very successful at her job as Director of the Arts Museum.
Of course, it also, at times, made her a terrible friend. Her quest for new acquaintances often meant she had to meet the same person several times to remember them.
"Ready for the desserts, Jess?" Kyle appeared at her shoulder, like a ninja.
"Great job reading the crowd, Kyle. They'll be milling by for sweets any time now. Start with the petits-fours and fruit trays. We'll use the cookies later, if we need to."
Kyle disappeared as quickly as he'd come as Jess continued closing up the Sterno warmers and making room on the tables for the dessert platters. Her mind was already on the meeting with Felicity tomorrow. A Chinese New Year celebration could mean all kinds of neat dishes. Lots of finger foods, if it was meant to be a cocktail party. Felicity had a knack for planning lavish balls and fundraisers and this would be no different.
"Excuse me, Jess?" a soft tenor voice pierced her thoughts.
She looked up to the most surprising eyes she had ever seen, and yet there was something slightly familiar about them.
"Jess, it is you! It's great to have you back in town! How long have you been back?" the eyes said. They were a rich gold color, with streaks of milk-chocolate brown radiating from the iris. The eyelashes that framed them were a mix of the same colors.
She shook her head to loosen her tongue. "I've been back about five years," she whispered. Her throat had tightened as she studied his face. "I'm sorry," she cleared her throat to reclaim some authority in her voice, "do I know you?"
"Sorry, didn't occur to me you wouldn't remember me. Donovan Marshall. We were in school together?" He stuck out his hand for a shake and Jess stared at it before snapping her gaze back to his face.
"Donny Marshall?" shock seeping through her veins as she took his hand. It was warm and firm, and nothing like she remembered of her old boyfriend. How could she have not recognized him? Had he changed that much?
"I go by Van now. A little more respectable in the real estate market. Only been back to town a few months myself, but boy is it good to see you, Jess."
They engaged in more small talk and exchanged phone numbers. Her mind worked tirelessly to reconcile the self-conscious soccer player she had known in high school with the confident thirty-something real estate agent before her now. His six-foot frame still towered over her petite five-foot-two build, but his sandy hair had turned millions of shades of brown and blonde, instead of the plain mousy color of his youth. He had barely developed facial hair in his teens, and his skin was soft and smooth despite his active outdoor lifestyle. Now, his beard shadowed golden skin and strong cheekbones that curved into a firm jawline and round chin.
She continued to stare after him as he walked away, admiring the fit form of his body, so different, and yet the same as it was before.
Ninja-in-training Kyle appeared at her shoulder again. "Are you done with that, or are you planning on recycling it by hand?" he teased, gesturing at the piece of foil she had been massaging in her hand.
"What? Oh, I'm done with it. Let's get this wrapped up, huh?"
The meeting had dwindled while she chatted with Van - Van, she mused. Even the name gave her goosebumps.]]></SceneContent>

Freewrite:

Loud, fun, chaotic family dinner night. Jess is an only child and is close to her parents, Jennifer and Jacob. Jennifer was a stay-at-home mom, and eventually started an online business selling custom crocheted items. Jacob was a history teacher at Heartsburg High, until he retired last year. The couple had started their family later in life due to health issues Jennifer had in her twenties. They met in college (Jennifer was an English major and had always planned to teach), but she began developing symptoms of lupus due to the stress of her studies and didn’t finish. She suffered kidney failure and needed a transplant their senior year. They were married in the hospital just before she went into surgery. He finished his degree while she finished recovering in the hospital. They went to the Florida Keys for their honeymoon after graduation and she got out of the hospital.

He started off teaching in Columbia, but they didn’t like the “city” life (they were both from rural parts - him from SC, her from GA), so he took a pay cut and they moved to the first rural school that was hiring (Heartsburg). They eventually had Jess in their late 20’s and, though he was eligible for state retirement over a decade ago, Jacob finally decided to take his Social Security retirement at age 62 and look into a new career online and studying local history for the Historical Society in town.

Jess will get the skinny on Van. He’s been in Raleigh, NC for the past 10 years. He got a business degree from USC in Columbia, then moved to Raleigh for a job. He decided he didn’t like working for someone else, so went to night classes to get a real estate license so he could work for himself. He married a girl in Raleigh, but she expected bigger city life. She left him after clearing the joint bank account, so he sold his house in Raleigh and moved back home. His parents had recently passed away, and he and his brother had inherited the family home. He hasn’t decided yet if he’s going to stay or not, but he has continued his business from a distance (with the help of assistants and underlings).

Jess will also hear about the recent construction at the Williams Plantation outside of town. Jacob will fill her in on the local history regarding the property.]]></SceneContent>
